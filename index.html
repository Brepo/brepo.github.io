						<p>3D printers are considered to be one of the best inventions of modern times. <br />
						They do incredible things. They create magic. <br />
						Yet in order to be a regular household tool, these printers need 
						to be able to finish their job in minutes, not hours. <br /><br />Very few 3D printer companies have attempted to fix this problem.<br />
						Most of the time, their focus is either on cost or aesthetics. <br />
						The very few companies that attempt to maximize speed
						simply consider it just an additional feature. <br /><br />Readybox has solved this problem. <br /><br /></p>
						<h2>It is completely designed for speed-
						<br />
						Everything else is an added feature.</h2>

							<h3>Faster Extrusion</h3>
							<p>A new, high flow extruder design coupled with a clog-free nozzle means that filament can be extruded <b>more than 6 times faster than existing 3D printers</b> without the risk of clogging or damaging the printer's mechanics.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
						
							<h3>Smoother Movement</h3>
							<p> A low friction movement system allows the print head to move incredibly fast, while still retaining all the accuracy of other, slower printers.</p>
						</section>
					</div>
					<div class="features-row">
						<section>
						
							<h3>Light Design</h3>
							<p>A small, light print head helps the printer achieve extremely high accelerations, allowing it to take full advantage of other hardware and software improvements and achieve the fastest speed in the market.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							
							<h3>Better Tech</h3>
							<p> A next generation 32bit ARM based controller board brings the software and hardware together to create a seamless, easy printing experience.</p>
						</section>
					</div>
						<div class="features-row">
						<section>
							
							<h3>Easier Use</h3>
							<p>Due to its <b>auto-leveling capabilities</b>, all you need to do is press a button and it will calibrate automatically. It also utilizes a <b>clog-free nozzle</b>, meaning that the filament will never get stuck (which is a huge problem with almost every other consumer 3D printer).</p>
						</section>
						<section>
						
							<h3>Huge build Area</h3>
							<p> Readybox is one of the most space efficient 3D printers on the market. Though it has an enormous build area (15"x15"x16"-<b>one of the largest build areas under $10000</b>), the printer itself is only 21"x21"x21.5". This means you can set one up in your room with absolutely no hassle!</p>
